# NodeProjects

A Compilation of practice projects using Node.js, Heroku, REST Server

## Projects

---

1. node-basis: A project aimed to reinforce the understanding of the basic features of Node.js. Consists of a program that writes multiplicative tables and/or displays them through the CLI.

2. to-do-app : A simple CLI to-do tracking application. The app does the following:

   - create a new task
   - delete a particular task
   - list all tasks

3. climate-app: A simple weather information app. This project uses the following API: ~~[City Geo-Location Lookup [DEPRECATED]](https://rapidapi.com/dev132/api/city-geo-location-lookup)~~.
   Instead, we will use the following API instead: [Open Weather Map](https://www.openweathermap.org).
   To fecth the REST API, we will use axios instead of request. Since the focus of this little app is to master JS promises.
